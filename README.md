Database Management Systems Course Project (C#, SQL, SQL server, Visual Studio)

This Project was made from Scratch by us, except for 'Controller.cs' and 'DBMan.cs'. All the forms, the queries, the Database Tables, were made by us.

|--------------------------User-Orieted Description------------------------------|

This Progarm was made to serve as a DBMS for a Restaurant and it Warehouse by providing Forms for the Following Users:

-Chef: Whose main job is to edit ingredients of a menu item, edit their availability, and Follow-up with orders and change their status (Done/Waiting..)

Cashier: Whose job is to add/remove orders and customers
-Supervisor: Branch Supervisor, can view some branch-related statistical Data (view most active customers, supplies bought in a given time period...etc)

|--------------------------Technical Description------------------------------|

The Project Consisted of two related sections:

1- Databse (Not included, to prevent re-use of the Program, or at least make it very hard):

Tables Created Using SQL Server Management Studio with Data That we made-up to simulate a real-life case.
SQL queries integrate into the second part.
2- GUI:

Interactive Inteface made using C# Forms.
Functions written in C# that call SQL Queries and some times retreive DataTables.
